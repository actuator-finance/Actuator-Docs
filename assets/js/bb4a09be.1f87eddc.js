Stakers can mint any amount of HTTs whenever they choose as many times as they want, as long as the total quantity minted doesn't exceed the extractable HEX value of the stake for the chosen redemption day (see 'Extractable HEX value' for more info).

If HTTs have been minted, stakers are not able to early end stake, nor are they able to tokenize their HSI (i.e. revoke delegation) until they've retired all HTTs.
