This intrinsic amount of HEX is always growing, knowable at any given time, and unlockable at end stake. Actuator leverages these properties by allowing HEX stakers to mint a new type of token backed by the intrinsic HEX value of their stake. We're calling these tokens 'HEX Time Tokens' (HTTs). HTTs are fungible ERC20 tokens backed 1:1 by HEX at all times and redeemable 1:1 for HEX after end stake when the underlying HEX becomes unlocked. Notably, this approach enables distinct stakes to utilize their common collateral (intrinsic HEX value), and gain shared liquidity through a single, fungible token (assuming a common HTT redemption day)."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"actuator-protocol-overview",children:"Actuator Protocol Overview"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Actuator is a decentralized protocol that wraps existing or new HEX stakes with additional functionality. Stake owners can mint fungible ERC20 tokens called 'HEX Time Tokens' (HTTs) backed 1:1 by their stake's underlying HEX. For every HEX Time Token minted, 1 HEX token is designated as collateral. The quantity of collateralized HEX is capped by the intrinsic HEX value of the underlying stake (i.e. staked HEX + accrued HEX rewards to date). Stakers can choose to forgo their collateralized HEX by selling their HTTs into the market or they can regain control of their collateral by retiring (i.e. returning) their HTTs any time before the designated redemption day. All outstanding HTTs are redeemable 1:1 for HEX on or after the designated redemption day. The redemption day is chosen by the staker when the HTTs are created and must fall on or after the end day of the underlying stake. Only one HTT can be minted for every one HEX staked or rewarded for a given HSI. Within a stake, any HEX that does not back HTTs (i.e. non-collateralized HEX) is simply collected by the original staker at end stake. No coordination, special timing, capacity limits or centralized intervention is required at any time. Prior to redemption day, the HTTs could be bought or sold through trading pools, allowing stakers to easily liquidate the intrinsic value of their stake at a fair price. Additionally, users can purchase HTTs (at the desired redemption day) and lock in a fixed rate of return (assuming the HTT trades at a discount to HEX) given they will be able to redeem their HTTs for the underlying HEX. Subsequently, this would result in a market-driven emergent yield curve for HEX across various redemption days thus creating new information for the HEX ecosystem to benchmark investments and drive new tools/opportunities."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"actuator-wrapped-stakes",children:"Actuator Wrapped Stakes"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Every Actuator wrapped stake is a Hex Stake Instance (HSI) and thus Actuator rides on top of the Hedron protocol. Actuator wrapped stakes can be created through the Actuator contract (which then invokes the Hedron contract and creates the HSI) or existing HSIs can be delegated to the Actuator contract. Actuator wrapped stakes retain the ability to mint Hedron at any time and can always be unwrapped back into a standard tokenized HSI. Once created/delegated, stakers can mint 'HEX Time Tokens' (HTTs) against the stake's underlying HEX value. Stakers can mint any amount of HTTs whenever they choose as many times as they want, as long as the total quantity minted doesn't exceed the intrinsic HEX value of the stake. Additionally, users can retire any or all tokens they've minted at any time. If HTTs have been minted, stakers are not able to early end stake, nor are they able to tokenize their HSI until they've retired all HTTs. This ensures the system accounting is always balanced and guarantees 1 HTT will always be redeemable for 1 HEX at the designated redemption day.

HTT holders have 2 weeks to redeem their tokens for HEX without penalty. However, after 2 weeks, HTT holders cannot be guaranteed a 1:1 redemption for HEX. This is due to the behavior of the HEX protocol. Since HTTs are backed by stakes, and stakes that end after 14 days begin to incur late penalties, these penalties will impact HTT redemption. After 2 weeks, redemption is on a first come first serve basis. With that being said, it may be the case that all redemptions after 14 weeks can still exchange 1:1 for HEX if all underlying stakes are unlocked on time.

Users who attempt to redeem their HTTs may end up paying large sums of gas fees to initiate multiple end stakes. However, the system mostly eliminates these concerns by penalizing original stakers who fail to end their stake and rewarding community end staking. All rewards accrued in the last 10% of a stake's life are held in 'escrow' and are not eligible for HTT collateral. Stakers who fail to end stake in a timely manner forgo up to all escrowed rewards. These rewards are instead credited to any user who initiates the end stake. Stakers have 3 grace days before escrowed rewards begin flowing to the end staker. Each day after the grace period (3 days), an additional 1/10th of the escrowed rewards are credited to the end staker up to the 10th day where 100% of escrowed rewards go the end staker. This gradual, linear increase ensures there's a 'break even' day where the end stake rewards equal or exceed the cost of gas when end staking.
