# Use Cases
- Actuator Wrapped HSIs
  - Gain **instant liquidity on existing HSI** by delegating to Actuator and then minting HEX Time Tokens against the intrinsic stake value (i.e. staked HEX + HEX rewards to date)
  - Get **instant liquidity back on new HEX stakes** 
  - **Progressively liquidate** earned stake rewards for providing regular income stream
  - **Preserve optionality** in the event the stake needs to be liquidated at a future date
  - Achieve leveraged HEX Stake returns through **Amplified Stakes** 
- HEX Time Tokens (HTT)
  - Lock in a **fixed rate** of return on HEX through purchase of HTTs
  - gain exposure to **leveraged HEX without liquidation** 
  - Indirectly **participate in the upside of HEX staking** stake while retaining liquidity
  - **Hedge** undesirable changes in the HEX yield curve (e.g. hedge duration risk)
  - **Arbitrage** temporarily mispriced HTTs
  - **Speculate** on changing yield curve shape
  - Utilize yield curve to **identify and implement optimal HEX staking strategy**
