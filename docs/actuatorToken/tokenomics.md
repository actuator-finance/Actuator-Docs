# Tokenomics

## Total Token Supply

The total supply of Actuator is capped at **1 billion tokens**, which will be fully distributed over the course of three years from the launch date.

## Allocation Details

### Liquidity Farms

75% (750,000,0000 ACTR) of the total supply is allocated to liquidity farms. This distribution is scheduled as follows:

- **Year 1**: 350,000,000 tokens
- **Year 2**: 250,000,000 tokens
- **Year 3**: 150,000,000 tokens

These tokens are intended to incentivize participation in the liquidity pools.

### Team Allocation

25% (250,000,0000 ACTR) of the total token supply is initially minted to the team address at contract launch. 1% of the 25% will immediately be sent to the Forge for reviewers and NFT holders. 100% of the remaining ACTR tokens will be transferred to an immutable "Time Lock" contract where the tokens are locked. From there, the ACTR tokens are gradually unlocked over the course of three years and follow the same unlock schedule as the farms. This ensures the team control of ACTR tokens never exceeds 24% of the circulating supply at any point in time. This distribution is scheduled as follows:

- **Year 1**: 111,360,000 tokens
- **Year 2**: 79,680,000 tokens
- **Year 3**: 48,960,000 tokens
