## Allocation Details

### Liquidity Farms

75% (750,000,0000 ACTR) of the total supply is allocated to liquidity farms. This distribution is scheduled as follows:

- **Year 1**: 350,000,000 tokens
- **Year 2**: 250,000,000 tokens
- **Year 3**: 150,000,000 tokens

These tokens are intended to incentivize participation in the liquidity pools.

### Team Allocation

25% (250,000,0000 ACTR) of the total token supply is initially minted to the team address at contract launch. 1% (10,000,000 ACTR) of the 25% will immediately be sent to the Forge for reviewers and NFT holders. 5% (50,000,000 ACTR) of the 25% will be used for ACTR liquidity management. The remaining 19%  (190,000,000 ACTR) will be transferred to an immutable "Time Lock" contract where the tokens are locked. From there, the ACTR tokens are gradually unlocked to the team over the course of three years and follow the same unlock schedule as the farms. This distribution is scheduled as follows:

- **Year 1**: 88,160,000 tokens
- **Year 2**: 63,080,000 tokens
- **Year 3**: 38,760,000 tokens
