# ACTR Vaults

ACTR vaults provide ACTR token holders with a flexible and beneficial way to earn rewards in HTTs. To participate in the rewards, token holders must deposit their ACTR into a vault controlled by the Actuator token contract. During this process, depositors will select a vault which are distinguished by which HEX Time Token they will receive as rewards. 

### Choosing the HEX Day.

- **HTT Choice**: When you deposit your ACTR tokens, you must designate which HTT rewards you will participate in. For example, if you deposit in the vault that rewards HTT-3000, you will earn a portion of all fees generated from the creation of HTT-3000.
- **Flexibility**: Depositors can allocate 100% of their ACTR tokens to one vault or spread them across multiple vaults and earn a variety of HTTs. This allows you to focus on the HTTs where you expect higher fees and and thus returns.

## Fees and Rewards

- **Fee Imposition**: Each creation of a HTT incurs a 1% fee.
- **Distribution**: These fees are immediately distributed to users who have deposited their ACTR to the corresponding vault on pro-rata basis. This mechanism ensures that rewards are aligned with depositor contribution size and market activities.

## Deposit and Withdraw

- **Lock-Up Period**: There is a 90-day lock-up period to ensure vaults are resistant to manipulations. Any increase in user deposits will reset the user's 90-day lock-up period. 
- **Early Unlock Penalty**: Depositors who decide to withdraw early incur a penalty starting at 100% and decreasing linearly to 0% at the end of the lock-up period. ACTR is therefore deflationary beginning after the initial 3 year distribution period.

## Benefits of ACTR Vaults

- **Direct Rewards**: Earn HTTs from HTT creation fees. 
- **Recapturing Fees**: By depositing into the vault that earns the same HTT you're about to mint against your HEX stake, you can recapture some or all of the HTT fees pay. 
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Allocate your tokens in a way that best suits your confidence and expected reward outcomes from different HTTs.
