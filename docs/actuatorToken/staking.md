# Staking

Actuator Token Staking provides token holders with a flexible and beneficial way to earn rewards in HTTs. To participate in staking, token holders must stake their ACTR into the Actuator token contract. During this process, stakers will select a designated HEX day, determining the type of Hex Time Token (HTT) rewards they are eligible to receive.

### Choosing the HEX Day.

- **HEX Day Designation**: When you stake your ACTR tokens, you must designate a HEX day which determines which HTT rewards you will participate in. e.g. if you stake in HEX day 3000, you will earn the fees generated from the creation of HTT-3000.
- **Flexibility**: Stakers can allocate 100% of their Actuator tokens to one HEX day or spread them across multiple HEX days. This allows you to focus on the HTTs where you expect higher fees and and thus returns.

## Fees and Rewards

- **Fee Imposition**: Each creation of a HTT incurs a 1% fee.
- **Distribution**: These fees are immediately distributed to Actuator token stakers within that corresponding stake pool on a pro-rata basis. This mechanism ensures that rewards are aligned with staker contributions and market activities.

## Staking and Unstaking

- **Lock-Up Period**: There is a 90-day lock-up period to ensure staking is resistant to manipulations. 
- **Early Unlock Penalty**: Stakers who decide to end their stake early incur a penalty starting at 100% and decreasing linearly to 0% at the end of the lock-up period.

## Benefits of Staking

- **Direct Rewards**: Earn rewards from HTT creation fees. 
- **Recapturing Fees**: By staking in the same HEX day where you create HTTs, you can recapture any fees you might pay. 
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Allocate your tokens in a way that best suits your confidence and expected reward outcomes from different HTTs.
