# Introduction

Any given HEX stake has an 'intrinsic value' defined as the initial HEX staked plus accrued HEX rewards to date. This intrinsic amount of HEX is always growing, knowable at any given time, and unlockable at end stake. Actuator leverages these properties by allowing HEX stakers to mint a new type of token backed by the intrinsic HEX value of their stake. We're calling these tokens 'HEX Time Tokens' (HTTs). HTTs are fungible ERC20 tokens backed 1:1 by HEX at all times and redeemable 1:1 for HEX after end stake when the underlying HEX becomes unlocked. Notably, this approach enables distinct stakes to utilize their common collateral (intrinsic HEX value), and gain shared liquidity through a single, fungible token (assuming a common HTT redemption day).
