# Glossary

**Actuator**: A decentralized protocol that wraps existing or new HEX stakes with additional functionality, allowing users to mint HEX Time Tokens (HTTs) against their stakes.

**ACTR Token**: The native token of the Actuator protocol, used for revenue sharing.

**Amplified Stakes**: A strategy where users create new stakes, mint HTTs, sell them, and use the proceeds to create additional stakes, potentially achieving higher returns.

**Collateralized HEX**: HEX tokens that are locked as backing for minted HTTs.

**Intrinsic Value**: The total value of a HEX stake, including the initial staked amount plus accrued rewards to date.

**Extractable Value**: The amount of HTTs that can be minted against the stake's underlying HEX, which may be less than the intrinsic value in some cases.

**Escrow**: The portion of stake rewards (final 10% accrued during a stake's life) that is reserved for the community end stake subsidy.

**HEX Time Token (HTT)**: An ERC20 token minted against a HEX stake, redeemable 1:1 for HEX at the designated future day (redemption day).

**HSI (HEX Stake Instance)**: A tokenized representation of a HEX stake, introduced by the Hedron protocol.

**Redemption Day**: The specific day when an HTT becomes redeemable for HEX, indicated in the token's symbol (e.g., HTT-2000).

**Redemption**: The act of exchanging HTTs for the underlying HEX tokens at or after the designated redemption day.

**Retirement**: The process of returning minted HTTs to regain full control of the underlying stake before redemption day.

**Risk-Free Rate**: In the context of Actuator, the guaranteed return rate in HEX terms when purchasing HTTs at a discount.

**Yield Curve**: A representation of the rates of return for HTTs across different redemption days, derived from their discounts relative to HEX.
