# System Invariants/Properties
- 1 HEX Time Token (HTT) is always backed and redeemable for 1 HEX at the designated redemption day.
- The total quantity of HTTs that can be minted against a stake cannot exceed the principal + accrued interest (assuming redemption falls on end stake day)
- The quantity of HTTs minted against a stake is exactly equivalent to the quantity of HEX the staker forgoes at end stake. Ownership of the stake's remaining underlying HEX is retained by the staker. 
- Any time before end stake, stakers can regain full ownership/control of their stake by returning the quantity of HTTs minted.
