## Financial Audits
#### Dedaub (In progress)
Dedaub is currently performing a financial audit which seeks to verify these key financial invariants: 
- 1 'HEX Time Token' (HTT) is always redeemable for 1 HEX at the designated redemption day. 
- After minting HTTs against a stake, the quantity of HEX the staker forgoes at end stake is exactly equivalent to the quantity of HTTs created.
