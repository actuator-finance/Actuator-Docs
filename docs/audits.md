## Security Audits

#### Dedaub (Scheduled)
Dedaub will be performing an audit on the core Actuator contract: HEXTimeTokenManager.sol. 

## Financial Audits
#### Dedaub (Scheduled)
Dedaub will be performing a narrow financial audit which seeks to verify the following financial invariants: 
- 1 'HEX Time Token' (HTT) is always redeemable for 1 HEX at the designated redemption day. 
- After minting HTTs against a stake, the quantity of HEX the staker forgoes at end stake is exactly equivalent to the quantity of HTTs created.
